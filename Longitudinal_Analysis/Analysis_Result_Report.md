## Analyze Efficacy of Emotional Exposure Therapy (EET) for Fibromyalgia (FM) in Randomized Clinical Trial

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic disorder that causes widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness. Since the conventional interventions, which target behaviors and cognition, have limited efficacy, a two-site, three-arm, allegiance-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) for FM investigated the benefit of emotional exposure therapy (EET). In order to test the efficacy of EET compared to Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and FM Education (EDU), a linear spline generalized estimating equation (GEE) was applied to the clinical trial dataset. The GEE model showed that the efficacy of EET was beneficial to the pain reduction (p-value < 0.001), but not significantly beneficial (p-value = 0.073) to CBT and EET. 

## Introduction

More than 3 million Americans per year suffer from fibromyalgia (FM), which is a disorder accompanied by widespread muscle pain, tenderness and fatigue and therefore, affect people‚Äôs mood. FM cannot be cured, and conventional approaches to FM have only targeted relief of behaviors and cognition symptoms. According to the updated pain definition [1], FM pain is defined as a distressing experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage with sensory, emotional, cognitive, and social components. Moreover, it has been shown that psychological interventions help to manage patients‚Äô chronic pain [2]. Thus, it is important to consider psychological treatment for mitigation of the chronic pain for FM. Previous smaller studies suggest that the techniques involving emotional exposure and processing are efficacious for FM. However, these components had not been combined into a theoretically integrated emotional exposure therapy (EET) and the efficacy of EET had not been tested in a controlled, clinical trial. Therefore, a multi-site group randomized clinical trial (RCT) [3] examined the efficacy of EET, which targets psychological treatment for reducing stress, compared to the conventional interventions, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and FM education (EDU). The EET encouraged patients to disclose stressful experiences and increase expression of emotions through weekly sessions and homework. CBT focused on cognitive and behavioral exercises to manage FM symptoms rather than the emotional factor. EDU provided knowledge about FM in terms of its definition, diagnoses, medications and research methods in order to increase patient‚Äôs understanding and thus, decrease uncertainty and reduce defensiveness. Through RCT, the main interest of outcome was pain reduction following treatments.

## Methods

This clinical trial design was a 2-site, 3-arms, allegiance-controlled RCT. At the Wayne State University and the University of Michigan, participants were recruited and evaluated through screening processes by inclusion and exclusion criteria from the trial protocol. A total of 230 adults (94% female, n = 216, mean age of females = 49.5) with FM were assigned randomly to small groups. Each group provided one of three treatments, EET, CBT, and EDU. Through eight weekly small-group sessions, the three treatments were compared on key health outcomes, such as clinical and psychophysical pain testing, subjective disability and objective physical activity, fatigue, mood, and sleep problems at baseline, 3- and 9-month follow-up evaluation. Since the research question was to compare the efficacy of EET compared to CBT and EDU in terms of pain relief, the primary outcome measurement was the change of pain from baseline and the metric was subjective clinical pain evaluated from the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI; 162), which assess current pain and highest, lowest, and average pain during the past week. Each BPI has scale from 0 to 10, and the lower scale is, the less pain occurs. The pain score from the four items was averaged in order to combine all the pain severity. Since the depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms were collected for secondary outcome measures, they were not included in this analysis in order to address the main research question. Demographic variables were collected, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), ethnicity, race, highest educational level, total tender points, fibromyalgianess, and a score of symptoms evaluated by Complex Medical Symptoms Inventory. In order to check the validity of randomization, the demographic variables at baseline were compared across three treatments. For continuous variables, one-way ANOVA test and Kruskal-Wallis test were conducted respectively if the data followed normal and non-normal distributions in order to compare the means across treatments. In the case of categorical/binary variables, the Chi-square test and Fisher‚Äôs exact test were applied to test the difference in proportions between treatments. If the randomization was valid and there were no other risk factors, such as a site effect, then it would guarantee that the treatments are the only factor to contribute to the outcome, pain score in a longitudinal analysis model. Since a generalized estimating equation (GEE) enables to analyze the repeated measurements in a marginal level, the data was modeled with a spline GEE model based on a mean trend plot and the validity of randomization. When it comes to modeling, a covariance structure for repeated outcome measurements was determined based on the form of unstructured covariance for the values. With the specified covariance structure, coefficients from the fitted GEE model were estimated and tested by comparing two nested models. Finally, residuals from the fitted GEE model were used to do diagnostics. For missing values, the percentages of missingness were evaluated, which implicated how to deal with the missingness in this dataset. The longitudinal analysis was conducted in R and specifically the ‚Äògeepack‚Äô package[4] was used to fit GEE models.

## Results

At baseline, each demographic variable were examined across treatments in order to check the validity of randomization. According to test results, FM patients were randomly assigned to each treatment arm. Moreover, the effect of different site was tested across treatment arms and there was no evidence to say that interventions were different from sites (p-value = 0.2). This implied that the stratification was not necessary in modeling process. Figure 1 suggests that a linear spline pattern for each treatment over time, therefore, the linear spline GEE model was selected to model the dataset. Based on the validity of randomization and the spline pattern for the repeated measurements of change in pain score, the linear spline GEE model was fitted to the dataset.

__Figure 1.__ Mean trend plots of the change of pain score from baseline for three treatments (EET, CBT and EDU).
The mean trend plots for treatments suggest a linear spline GEE model for the RCT. Time (Baseline, 3 months and 9 months) indicates that baseline, post-treatment and 6 months follow-up, respectively. EET and CBT show decreasing first and increasing again over time, whereas EDU shows decreasing pattern over time.

In order to make easy interpretations, EET was chosen to be a reference treatment. For a covariance structure, an exchangeable covariance structure was selected based on empirical correlation matrix of pain scores over time. The ‚Äògeeglm‚Äô function from ‚Äògeepack‚Äô package in R was applied to estimate parameters with its standard error based on a sandwich variance estimator, which are shown in Table 1.

Since the three treatments were randomly assigned at baseline, the treatment effect was not included in the linear spline GEE model. Moreover, an intercept was excluded to make reasonable comparison across treatments, that is, the primary outcome is the change of pain score from baseline and the change should be zero across treatments at baseline.

In Table 1, each estimate means a mean slope in Figure 1 in time segments. Since EET was a reference treatment, the first two estimates are the common estimates of the mean of change in pain score at 3 or 9 months from baseline, comparing both CBT and EDU to EET. The rest of estimates were interpreted as the mean difference of change in pain score from baseline in each treatment (CBT and EDU) compared to EET at 3 or 9 months from baseline. For example, the expected mean of pain score in EET at 3 months decreases 0.93 (se = 0.08) compared to baseline. On the other hand, the estimate for Time √ó CBT (0.18, se = 0.10) is the expected mean difference of change in pain score comparing CBT to EET at 3 months follow-up from baseline. 


By the way, Table 1 addresses that there is at least one treatment, which shows different efficacy in reduction of pain among three treatments. In order to see which treatments show different efficacy, post-hoc analysis was done and it resulted in EET had no significant difference in reduction of pain (p-value = 0.40) compared to CBT, but significant difference (p-value = 0.02) compared to EDU. Figure 1 shows consistent interpretation of this result. 


For diagnostics, the mean model assumption was checked through residual analysis, which were shown in Appendix Figure A1. Moreover, the percentages of missingness were calculated for each variable and they were assumed to be no pattern in the missingness in order to apply the GEE model.


## Discussion

The linear spline GEE analysis concluded that EET was beneficial to reduce the chronic pain for FM compared to EDU, but not enough to say that EET is beneficial to CBT. 

There were multiple limitations in this longitudinal analysis. Firstly, the follow-up period was not long and repeated measures were only collected twice. If the longer periods of observations were available, then it would give more reliable results. Secondly, there would be a selection bias that might come from the nature of the RCT design. Since the patients were filled up each treatment group according to first-come first-serve way, it could possibly contaminate the structure of correlated measurements and thus, randomization might be threatened. Even though the RCT would try to recruit more patients or increase the number of groups in order to remove the possible selection bias, there would be trade-off between the two ways due to the limit of budgets or the decrease of analysis power. Besides, it is possible to exist unobserved confounders. During the 8 therapy sessions, patients could be affected from other environmental components, which were not controlled by this RCT. Lastly, subjective ratings for the symptoms are not robust and therefore, it would be good to incorporate the individual‚Äôs susceptibility variable in the model in order to compensate the individual variations.

Not only the limitation in the dataset, but also there were two concerns in the analysis. From the property of the GEE, using the sandwich estimator may lose the statistical power if the covariance was correctly specified. Secondly, FM symptoms were dependent to individuals and within- subject variations could be large. But, the marginal model, like GEE, did not consider subject‚Äôs level variation.

FM is a significant quality of life issue for people suffering from the chronic pain. In this study, I found that the emotional factor helped to reduce patients‚Äô pain in a short-term period and the better efficacy than the EDU therapy. Longer follow-up and incorporating other risk factors can confirm the durability of these findings.
